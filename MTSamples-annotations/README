##### Dataset ######

We downloaded and extracted documents from MTSamples (www.mtsamples.com),
a collection of Medical Transcription Sample reports for multiple clinical specialties
(where the same document can belong to different groups),
created for educational purposes and for working transcriptionists.

In the MTSamples resource, there is no availability of document creation times (DCTs).
Most documents follow a semi-structured format,
including different section headings/textual content depending on the specific clinical specialty.

We selected the following specialties for manual annotation and analysis:
* discharge summaries (108 documents)
* psychiatry-psychology (53 documents)
* paediatrics (70 documents)
* emergency (75 documents)

The number of unique documents is 286.

##### Manual Annotations #####

All documents were double-annotated for time expressions, as described in the BIONLP 2019 paper.
Annotation guidelines are available as a PDF file ("Annotation_guidelines_time_expressions_MTSamples").

Each folder (discharge-summaries, psychiatry-psychology, pediatrics, emergency) includes:
* textual documents (corpus.zip)
* manual annotations (all_annotations.txt).

Each row in the "all_annotations.txt" files represents an annotated time expression.
For each annotation, the following columns are available (tab separated):
['doc', 'overlap', 'text1', 'text2', 'type1', 'type2', 'val1', 'val2', 'start1', 'end1', 'start2', 'end2', 'sentence']
* doc: the document name
* overlap: used to measure the inter-annotator agreement for span overlap (TP: true positive, FP: false positive, FN: false negative)
* text1: string annotated by annotator 1
* text2: string annotated by annotator 2
* type1: type annotated by annotator 1
* type2: type annotated by annotator 2
* val1: value annotated by annotator 1
* val2: value annotated by annotator 2
* start1: start offset identified by annotator 1
* end1: end offset identified by annotator 1
* start2: start offset identified by annotator 2
* end2: end offset identified by annotator 2
* sentence: text surrounding the annotation
