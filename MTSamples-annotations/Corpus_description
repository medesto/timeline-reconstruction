We downloaded and extracted documents from MTSamples (www.mtsamples.com),
a collection of Medical Transcription Sample reports for multiple clinical specialties
(where the same document can belong to different groups),
created for educational purposes and for working transcriptionists.

In the MTSamples resource, there is no availability of document creation times (DCTs).
Most documents follow a semi-structured format,
including different section headings/textual content depending on the specific clinical specialty.

We selected the following specialties for manual annotation and analysis:
* discharge summaries (108 documents)
* psychiatry-psychology (53 documents)
* paediatrics (70 documents)
* emergency (75 documents)

The number of unique documents is 286.

Each folder includes the original documents (corpus) and the manual annotations (all_annotations).

Manual annotations are organised in the following columns (tab separated):

['doc', 'overlap', 'text1', 'text2', 'type1', 'type2', 'val1', 'val2', 'start1', 'end1', 'start2', 'end2', 'sentence']
* doc: the document name
* overlap: used to measure the inter-annotator agreement for span overlap (TP: true positive, FP: false positive, FN: false negative)
* text1: span annotated by annotator 1
* text2: span annotated by annotator 2
* type1: type annotated by annotator 1
* type2: type annotated by annotator 2
* val1: value annotated by annotator 1
* val2: value annotated by annotator 2
* start1: start offset for annotator 1
* end1: end offset for annotator 1
* start2: start offset for annotator 2
* end2: end offset for annotator 2
* sentence: text surrounding the annotation
